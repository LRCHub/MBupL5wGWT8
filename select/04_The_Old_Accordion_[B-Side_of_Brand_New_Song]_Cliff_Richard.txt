In the music shop window it hung like a clock on the wall
And the people passed by it to them it meant nothing at all
But the tears rolled down the face of Jacob O' Wrighton
For thirty pounds ten was a life time away from his heart

Well, he was one of a dozen
What mother just might have one more
So he left the backstreet plantation
And never looked back at the door
But his fear grew more round about midnight
He was only eight left alone with only his thoughts

Oh, if I could have that old accordion, he cried
If only I could hear it playing
I wouldn't need anybody to talk to
And then we could dance, dance, dance
How troubles away

He was feeling quite hungry and drags him off down on the floor
And he counted the patches sewn into the jeans that he wore
And the rain came down from then on till morning
He was awful cold and he wished he was back in his home

You know just when he thought
That his leaving meant nothing but homeless
A mother divorced called his name
And his eyes faded open
Oh, he woke from a dream in his head
And he thought he was dead
Oh, the old accordion lay it to put on his bed

Oh, if I could have that old accordion, he cried
If only I could hear it playing
I wouldn't need anybody to talk to
And then we could dance, dance, dance
How troubles away

And then we could dance, dance, dance
How troubles away.
