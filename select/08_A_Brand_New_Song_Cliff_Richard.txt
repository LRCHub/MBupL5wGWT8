Someday, it don't pay to get up out of bed
Seems like the whole world's overworked and underfed
But life is loaded with sweet surprises, you never know what it'll do
And just when you're planning on another raining day
The sun comes shining through

And somebody's singing a brand new song
There's something in the word, you know you never heard before
Somebody's singing a brand new song
It isn't a symphony, just a simple, little melody
But it's a song about love and we can always use one more

Sundown, you run down, your days are about to end
A long face, a sad eye, alone without a friend
You know you love her, you think you lost her, there's not much more you can do
And just when you're planning on another lonely night
She reaches out for you

And somebody's singing a brand new song
There's something in the word, you know you never heard before
Somebody's singing a brand new song
It isn't a symphony, just a simple, little melody
But it's a song about love and we can always use one more

Can you hear it

Somebody's singing a brand new song
There's something in the word, you know you never heard before
Somebody's singing a brand new song
It isn't a symphony, just a simple, little melody
But it's a song about love and we can always use one more

And somebody's singing a brand new song
There's something in the word, you know you never heard before
