I've got a brand new girlfriend
She is so lovely, lovely
I've got a new ex-girlfriend
She is so fat and ugly

Oh, not, you again
It gets worse every time
And one plus, two again
Won't work, I can't divide it

Well I let it go, I don't care
I love you when you're not there
A brand new song just for you
I'm not sorry, about the things I do

I've got a brand new song
It is so happy, happy
I've got a brand new attitude
It is so hateful, hateful

Oh, not, you again
It gets worse every time
And one plus, two again
Won't work, I can't divide it

Well I let it go, I don't care
I love you when you're not there
A brand new song just for you
I'm so sorry, but that's not true

You keep tellin' me
That it's so easy to forget it
You keep tellin' me
But I know I'll always regret it
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You keep tellin' me
That it's so easy to forget it
You keep tellin' me
But I know I'll always regret it

Well I let it go, I don't care
I love you when you're not there
A brand new song, done my best
I'm so sorry, sorry
About this mess
